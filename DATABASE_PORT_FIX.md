# Database Port Fix Summary

## Problem
After your PC shutdown and MySQL restart, you changed MySQL port from 3306 to 3307 to resolve connection issues. However, all PHP files were still trying to connect to the default port 3306, causing database connection failures.

## Solution Applied
Updated all database connection configurations to use port 3307 instead of the default port 3306.

## Files Updated

### Main Configuration Files:
- `db/config.php` - Main database configuration
- `hospital-admin-panel/db/config.php` - Admin panel database configuration

### Direct Database Connection Files:
- `submit_message.php` - Message submission
- `submit_form.php` - Patient form submission
- `show_pdata.php` - Patient data display
- `register.php` - Patient registration
- `messages.php` - Message handling
- `fetch_name.php` - Name fetching
- `download_receipt.php` - Receipt download
- `php/fetch_namesss.php` - Name fetching in php directory
- `db/fetch_namesss.php` - Name fetching in db directory

### Files Using Include (Automatically Fixed):
All files in `hospital-admin-panel/admin/php/` and `php/` directories use `include '../db/config.php'` or similar, so they automatically use the updated port.

## Changes Made
For each file, added:
```php
$port = 3307; // Add port number
```

And updated the mysqli connection to:
```php
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname, $port);
```

## Testing
Created `test_db_connection.php` to verify the database connection is working properly.

## Next Steps
1. Start your XAMPP Apache and MySQL services
2. Make sure MySQL is running on port 3307
3. Test the database connection by visiting `test_db_connection.php` in your browser
4. Test your frontend pages to ensure data is being fetched properly

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check that MySQL is running on port 3307 in XAMPP
2. Visit `http://localhost/hospital_backend/test_db_connection.php`
3. You should see "âœ… Connection successful!" and a list of database tables
4. Test your frontend pages to ensure they display data correctly
